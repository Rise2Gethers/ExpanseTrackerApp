## 🎯 About the Project

**Expanse Tracker** is a **Local-First** mobile application for personal financial management.

More than just an app, this project serves as a **Software Engineering Lab**. Conceived by two developers under the **[Rise2Gethers](https://github.com/Rise2Gethers)** organization, the goal is to simulate the real-life cycle of a software product within a major tech company. We focus not only on writing code but on fostering a culture of **collaborative development** and **scalable architecture**.

## 💡 The Differentiator (Engineering Culture)

Unlike traditional academic projects, we strictly follow market-standard processes to ensure quality and maintainability:

- **Agile Methodology:** Continuous flow using Kanban (GitHub Projects).
- **Professional Git Flow:** Direct commits to `main` are forbidden. We use the **Feature Branch Workflow**.
- **Code Review:** Pull Requests (PRs) are mandatory with cross-reviews before merging.
- **Vertical Slicing:** Focus on delivering small, functional pieces of value rather than monolithic layers.

## ✨ Features (MVP)

- [x] **UI Foundation:** Design System implementation with React Native Paper.
- [ ] **Dashboard:** Quick visualization of Current Balance and recent movements.
- [ ] **Transaction Management:** Record Income/Outcome in < 2 seconds.
- [ ] **Categories:** Flexible categorization system with icons and colors.
